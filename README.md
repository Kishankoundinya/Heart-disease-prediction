# Heart-disease-prediction
This project is a machine learning web app for predicting heart disease risk. It uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model trained on patient health data like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate. Input features are scaled for accuracy, and the model outputs 0 (No Disease) or 1 (Disease) for early risk detection.
